Few things have the potential to improve the performance of New Zealand’s building, construction and asset operation sectors as Building Information Modelling (BIM). BIM is the only improvement initiative likely to deliver a step-change, rather than an incremental gain in productivity.

What is BIM? 
BIM is a coordinated set of processes, supported by technology, that add value through the sharing of structured information for buildings and infrastructure assets. BIM adds value to the whole life of a built asset, from pre-design to operation. It paves the way for the application of modern digital technologies to the briefing, design, procurement, construction, handover and operation of an asset.

Our purpose - Accelerating the use of BIM in New Zealand. 
Because it is key to achieving significant increase in productivity, accelerating the use of BIM in the construction process has become a priority. It is vital that industry, clients and government begin to take advantage of its many benefits – especially during this time of high construction demand. New Zealanders need more affordable, quality buildings and infrastructure, now and in the future.
