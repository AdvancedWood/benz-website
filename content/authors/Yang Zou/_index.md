I am currently a Senior Lecturer (Above the Bar) in Construction Engineering and Management at the University of Auckland. I am also a Chartered Construction Manager (MCIOB), accredited by the Chartered Institute of Building (CIOB). I completed my doctoral training at the University of Liverpool in December 2017 and began my academic career at the University of Auckland in early 2018. Over the years, I have advanced from Lecturer to Senior Lecturer (Above the Bar) in 2024. I am the Director of the Smart Digital Lab (SDL) as well as Faculty Co-Champion (Academic Lead) of the new UoA-Trimble Technology Lab (TTL).

My research lies in the inter-disciplinary area of construction automation and robotics. Specifically, I have focused on applying Building Information Modelling (BIM), Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), Robotics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Extended Reality (VR/AR/MR), Smart Sensing and Visualisation, throughout the lifecycle of complex building and large-scale infrastructure systems, especially in the post-construction stage. I am particularly interested in building, testing and evaluating robotic solutions for intelligent operation and maintenance of built assets. My ultimate research goal is to develop a smarter, safer and better built environment to meet the new needs of a changing world.
