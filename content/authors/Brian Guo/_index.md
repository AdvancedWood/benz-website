I completed my PhD at the University of Auckland in 2016 and am now an Associate Professor in the Department of Civil and Natural Resources Engineering at the University of Canterbury. I also serve on the Department Research Committee and am a postgraduate co-director. I explore using digital technologies, such as Building Information Modelling (BIM), virtual reality (VR), and computer vision, to improve construction site situational awareness and hazard detection. My work on human-robot collaboration (HRC) also investigates safety challenges in integrating robotics into construction, using VR to simulate and analyze worker-robot interactions.

My research efforts have been recognized and supported through grants from prestigious bodies like the New Zealand Royal Society and the Building Research Association New Zealand (BRANZ). As an active member of the academic community, I contribute to the editorial boards of the Nature Portfolio journal Scientific Reports and the Elsevier journal Results in Engineering. Additionally, I have reviewed over 30 high-impact journals and have served as an external reviewer for the Hong Kong General Research Fund.
Currently, my research team is focusing on the following two projects:
Project 1: simulation-based multi-objective optimization project focused on the energy retrofit of school buildings. Funded by BRANZ and the Building Innovation Partnership (BIP), it aims to balance lifecycle cost, environmental impact, energy consumption, and thermal comfort.
Project 2: Enhancing situation awareness in human-robot collaboration using virtual reality. Funded by the Royal Society of New Zealand, this work explores the integration of advanced technologies to improve safety and efficiency in construction management.
