abstract: 'This talk focuses on BIM Implementation in Malaysia, covering the construction industry transformation programme and the role of education in maintaining BIM uptake in the industry. Associate Prof Dr. Ahmad Tarmizi Haron began research into BIM over 10 year ago touching on BIM implementation from the perspective of people, technology and organisation. This was instrumental in his role in setting-up Malaysian BIM certification centre MyBIM across the country in conjunction with tertiary institutions. MyBIM centres offer certification from basic theory and practice in BIM to architectural modelling, structural modelling, MEP modelling and BIM manager certifications. Dr Ahmad Tarmizi Haron serves as Associate Professor at Faculty of Civil Engineering Technology, Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP). He is currently leading the commercialisation office at UMP as the Dean of Commercialisation. As part of his involvement with the industry, he has been appointed as CIDB BIM Subject Matter Expert since 2019 to advise and execute BIM initiatives under Construction Industry Transformation Programme (CITP 2016-2020). He has vast experience in education, consultancy and project implementation associated with BIM and Digital Construction. BENZ expresses a profound gratitude to Associate Prof Dr. Ahmad Tarmizi Haron for sharing his perspective on future direction of BIM education in this talk.'
