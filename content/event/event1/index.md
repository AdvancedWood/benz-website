abstract: 'This talk by Taija Puolitaival covers over 10 year-long BIM journey of the Unitec School of Building Construction. The journey has included many highs and lows. These was discussed alongside the lessons learned during this time. One excellent teaching practice is reflecting on how well learners achieve set BIM learning objectives and this talk captures BIM assessment process. Taija Puolitaival is originally from Finland with a background in construction project management education, research and consultation. She is one of the founder members and a former chair of New Zealand BIM Education Working Group (NZBEWG) now named BIM Education New Zealand (BENZ), and also a former member of BIM Acceleration Committee (BAC) and various BAC sub-committees. She has been with Unitec since 2012, where her role, in addition to teaching and research, has involved the coordination of BIM integration into the four undergraduate programmes offered by the School of Building Construction (former Department of Construction): New Zealand Diploma in Construction, New Zealand Diploma in Architectural Technology, Bachelor of Construction, and Graduate Diploma in Construction Project Management. BENZ expresses a profound gratitude to Taija Puolitaival for sharing her perspective on future direction of BIM education in this talk.'
